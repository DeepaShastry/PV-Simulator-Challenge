Note:
This program takes ~1 mins to run as the producer generates 1000 random meter values and these values are witten to the .csv file with a time interval of 0.05s. This delay of 0.05s has been introduced just to mock values at different timestamp.
The delay can be removed in the real time scenarios where the meter provides household electricity consumption values continously throughout the day.
